For cohen_kappa_score:
    1. In English, this was done from the two individual tables data.
    2. In PT, this came out of getAnnotationsPT.py

The way to deal with this is to use the table specific dump for English and possibly edit getAnnotationsPT -- You could also use the single table dump for PT.

Either way this is something that you should certainly do now given how painful it is.

Start with data extraction though.
